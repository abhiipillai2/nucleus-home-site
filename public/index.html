                            Nucleus is a company that specializes in providing an innovative and cutting-edge solution for electrical energy management and savings. We offer a unique tool for businesses and individuals to better manage their energy usage and reduce costs through the AI-powered Building Management System (BMS) and automation platform. This BMS system is a machine learning platform that is still in the development phase but already offers a wide range of functions to customers.

One of the key features of Nucleus's BMS is energy management, which allows customers to monitor their energy consumption and optimize it for maximum efficiency. This can result in significant cost savings as well as a more sustainable energy usage model. Another critical function of the system is equipment failure detection, which uses real-time monitoring and analysis to quickly identify and address potential equipment failures before they become significant issues.

The platform also includes energy auditing capabilities, which help customers better understand their energy usage and identify areas where improvements can be made. Forecasting functions help predict future energy usage and demand, enabling customers to plan and adjust their energy usage accordingly. The peak demand analysis function is also beneficial, allowing customers to track peak energy usage and better manage these high-demand periods.

                            Nucleus Spectrum is an innovative product offered by Nucleus that provides customers with a comprehensive energy management solution to help them reduce energy consumption and save costs. By fetching real-time energy data and presenting it in an easy-to-use dashboard, Nucleus Spectrum enables businesses and individuals to monitor their energy consumption patterns and identify inefficiencies.

The portal displays a range of useful information, including total power consumption data, total bill, power factor curve, voltage curve, current curve, phase angle curve, active and reactive power analysis, apparent power analysis, demand analysis, and energy reports. By having access to all of this information, customers can easily monitor their energy usage and make data-driven decisions to optimize their energy consumption, reduce costs, and improve their sustainability.

In addition to the existing features, Nucleus is also developing an NILM (Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring) based system to segregate individual appliances and analyze their power consumption details. This feature will enable businesses and individuals to monitor individual pieces of equipment in real-time, providing them with a detailed understanding of the energy consumption patterns of each appliance. By identifying inefficiencies, customers can optimize their equipment usage and reduce energy costs further.
